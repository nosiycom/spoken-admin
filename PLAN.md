# Spoken Admin Portal - Project Plan

## Current Project Assessment

### Project Overview
**Spoken Admin Portal** is a Next.js-based admin dashboard for managing an AI-powered French learning mobile app. The project recently underwent a major authentication system migration from Clerk to Supabase, indicating active development and modernization efforts.

### Current State Analysis

**Strengths:**
- Modern tech stack (Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- Well-designed database schema with proper relationships and indexes
- Comprehensive security implementation (CORS, rate limiting, input validation)
- Production-ready AWS ECS deployment pipeline
- Clean component architecture with proper separation of concerns

**Critical Issues Identified:**
1. **Incomplete Supabase Migration**: Missing `createSupabaseAdminClient` function causing build warnings
2. **Broken Service Layer**: Services reference non-existent `adminClient` property
3. **Static Generation Conflicts**: Dashboard pages causing dynamic server usage errors
4. **Missing Analytics Integration**: Removed PostHog but analytics endpoints still reference it
5. **Orphaned Auth Test Page**: Development artifact present in production build
6. **AWS SDK v2 Deprecation**: Using deprecated AWS SDK version

**Missing/Incomplete Features:**
- Real course data integration (currently using mock data)
- Complete analytics dashboard functionality
- Content management CRUD operations
- User management capabilities
- File upload functionality
- Error monitoring and alerting
